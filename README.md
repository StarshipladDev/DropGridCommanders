This application is a collaborative project between ![Kevin][https://github.com/Nibby] and [myself][https://github.com/StarshipladDev]
We plan on implementing a turn-based video game where all actions are declared before events occur, meaning all player's 
units will act simultaneously. 
The project will be updated in branches, and merged into master when agreed-upon implementations are realized.
The project is still in the planning phase, and this README, along with proper documentation, will follow as the code base is built.
